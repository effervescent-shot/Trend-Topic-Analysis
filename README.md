# Trend-Topic-Analysis
This is semester projects from Distributed Information Systems Laboratory (LSIR) @ EPFL in spring 2020.

## Project Aim
This work strove to figure out what people talk about in Twitter in every
day in a high level topic groupping. We collected and analysed a big dataset of tweets
along with daily trending topics, clustered them and
categorised the trending topics into conventional me-
dia categories by using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). As result, we created clean dataset of tweets matched with their trend topics and their general categorizes. Interestingly, keywords naturally obtained in the process of LDA also can be used in summarization or description purposes in the
future for a particular category of news\texts.
